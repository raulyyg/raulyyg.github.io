  <p>I am in this course not only because I needed an elective track course to
    graduate, but because I wanted to persue a career path in front-end web development.
    I work full time for a tech company that specializes in digital inspections for
    construction sites. My role primarily relies on creating digital forms using HTML,
    CSS, JSON and Javascript. I also help with client facing as well. I am pretty
    knowledgeable with C++, JAVA, JSON, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git commands, and some PHP. </p>
